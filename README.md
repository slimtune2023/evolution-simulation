# evolution-simulation
Simulation of "synthetic" evolution over time with organisms represented by basic neural nets

Need to add
-> Health
-> Food/hunger
-> More continuous propagation of species
-> Form of crossing over between individuals in the population
-> Extinction events
-> More natural selection rules
